# Business Problem

Hotel cancellations directly impact revenue forecasting, occupancy planning, and staffing allocation.

This project analyzes booking data to identify key drivers of cancellation risk and improve demand predictability.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains hotel booking records including:

- Hotel type (Resort vs City)
- Lead time before arrival
- Market segment
- Deposit type
- Previous cancellations
- Booking changes
- Special requests
- Cancellation status (target variable)

  
## Analytical Approach

- Data preprocessing and factor encoding
- 80/20 train-test split
- Logistic regression modeling
- Model comparison using AIC
- Accuracy and misclassification evaluation
- ROC curve analysis

## Key Findings

- Longer lead times were associated with higher cancellation risk.
- City hotels exhibited higher variability in lead time among canceled bookings.
- Deposit type and market segment significantly influenced cancellation probability.
- Final model achieved ~80% classification accuracy.

## Business Impact

Insights from this model can help:

- Improve revenue forecasting accuracy
- Identify high-risk bookings earlier
- Optimize overbooking strategies
- Adjust deposit policies by segment
